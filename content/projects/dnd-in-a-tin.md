title: D&D in a Tin
---

## Elevator pitch

Say you're out camping with your D&D buddies, and you all wanted to play, you bring along

- A4 character sheets that get crumpled beyond recognition
- dice that get lost,
- pencils that get broken in transit.

All have got to be contained somehow, which can be large and cumbersome.

Imagine instead, you could store what you need in a 9x6.5x2.4cm (~3.5x2.5x1 inches) tin box. Protected, together, safe.

Well â€” look no further, I have your solution.

## Parts

### The Tin 

I mean, it's part of the name, it can't be too small else it isn't practical, too big and it defeats the point of the project. I think the size above hits a sweat spot. At least I *hope* it does, I've bought 10 of them. 

I've chosen a tin without a hinged so that it can double up as a dice tray and writing surface.

### Character sheet

This is something I have worked on the most. It's gone through various iterations.

I have settled on a single sided A4 printable that can be folded into an 8 page booklet with some cutting. This make it relatively simple for anyone to print and use for themselves, rather than faffing with staples and double sided printing.

Sure it doesn't look as professional, but, function over form.

### Small Pencil

Need something to write with, and fit in the small tin

### Pencil extender

A little superfluous, but tiny pencils are annoying, this makes it easier to write with.

### Small Dice

Though I haven't tested (I am a heathen and don't have a set of polyhedral dice, instead relying on digital dice) I am guessing full sized dice would not fit very well, and it seems thematically appropriate to buy smaller dice for this project.

## Ongoing

I feel like the character sheet is coming nearly to the point where I am happy with it as a deliverable.

The next step is other class specific templates, spells for example.
